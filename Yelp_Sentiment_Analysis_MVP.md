# Yelp Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction:

Our goal is to build unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning models to predict whether a business review text is positive or negative. Also, assigns topics(clustering) based on the raw text data to find out the business domains.Also,exploring the possibility to implement a recommendation system.

## Project Progress:

After importing the datasets from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) in json format, we selected a sample of 10000 observations. Then, we cleaned the raw text data by removing digits, punctuation, special characters stop words, non-English words, converting words to lower case, lemmatization, and adding a spell checker. Also, stars (rating) between 1 to 5 were converted to a sentiment with 4 and 5 = positive, 1 and 2 = negative, while dropping 3-stars ratings. Next, we applied vectorization and choose logistic regression as the baseline model with an excellent accuracy score of 95% with no overfitting. For Visualization, we used Scattertext as shown in the graph below.

## [Graph](https://abdulrahmanalia.github.io/):

The graph shows the distribution of the most commonly used words in the review text data depending on positive or negative sentiment. Were the x-axis representing the negative words and the y-axis representing the positive ones.
The top 3 positive words are (amazing, delicious, ramen) and the top 3 negative words are (manger, told, horrible).
The results from the graph show that we still have some repeated and stop words that need to be removed.

## Further Action:

Applying dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA/SVD to successfully build a recommendation system and topic clustering.Also, we need to continue cleaning and processing the text data to gain more meaningful insights.
